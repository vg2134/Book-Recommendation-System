# Book-Recommendation-System
Abstract
Book Recommendation Systems are widely popular these days and are used by almost all book
sellers. Not only are they beneficial for the bibliophiles, but also for the book sellers for a myriad
of reasons. A good book recommendation system is a key factor in increasing the sales of a
book seller as it increases the visibility of their books and creates a better customer experience.
In this project, we aim to build a Book Recommendation System based on the UCSD
Goodreads dataset. We also aim to gain valuable insights from the data which can be used for
finding the reading trends and publishing trends for a particular year. The tools and technologies
used in this project are MapReduce to clean the datasets and Hive to produce relevant results
in the form of trends and recommendations.
